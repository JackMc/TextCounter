## Text Counter!

This is a simple program that takes a file from the Android SMS system and
counts the frequency of words. Functionality will be expanded soon.

The file can be found at:
/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db. Save it as
'mmssms.db' in the same directory as you run the script.
